Recently completed VCE at Mount Waverley Secondary College in 2020, completed Software Development as a subject which further motivated me to undertake a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at RMIT. Outside of my studies, I play soccer and go to the gym to keep myself active. As a hobby, I do photography. An interesting fact about myself: I can cut my own hair.</p>

I developed an interest in technology at an early age when I was fascinated to explore how a computer worked, seeing the different components work together allowed me to understand the complexities of a computer. Recently, I’ve found Apple as a motivating factor towards my interests in Information Technology. Their ability to craft a product that can be used to change the world of technology, such as their newer laptops, have inspired me to comprehend the advances of technology in the near future.</p>

My interests are weighted towards programming since having the skills to write a program will be beneficial in the future, these skills could provide me with the creative freedom of writing my own programs. Learning how to use different programming languages will also be useful since it will allow me to expand my knowledge and my ability to create different types of programs. I would also expect to learn how to handle real world projects, being able to work on real world projects would help build my ability to collaborate with others to discuss and bring ideas to complete the project. Having these skills beforehand will ultimately ease my ability to meet deadlines in a job.</p>

Elida also utilises their access to technology by helping out charity, their focus on helping those in need stands out to me since they have the ability to use the latest available technology to change the lives of those who don’t have access to modern day equipment. Elida also focuses on the importance of working in a team, this appeals to me since the importance of collaborating and discussing ideas in a team environment can be an efficient process to complete a task.</p>

                    <div class="details-heading">MOTIVATION</div>
                    <p class="interest-paragraph-1">A lot of individuals around the world choose to walk or run to keep themselves active, and some participate in marathons to push their body to its limits. According to a report published by SFIA (Sports & Fitness Industry Association), approximately 50,052,000 runners participated in marathons across America in 2019. 29.2% (14,615,184) of those participants were aged between 18 to 24. Participants aged between 18 to 24 are highly likely to use a fitness app to help them track the progress of their fitness journey, and other social media apps during their free time. My project idea would be interesting towards those who use fitness apps and social media apps since the project idea essentially combines both of them together.</p>

                    <div class="details-heading">DESCRIPTION</div>
                    <p class="interest-paragraph-1">The app would consist of different pages such as a map page, a community page, and a progress page. First time users of the app would be greeted with a set of questions to determine their weight, height, gender, and age. The user can also select their preference for either the photography challenge or the scavenger hunt challenge, the user can change their preference in the settings later. After answering the questions, the user has an option to create an account which allows them to interact with other users in the community page. Similar to the Google Maps app, where the user can input a destination and the app will recommend a route, my app would display a similar route but with the addition of the user being able to walk/run past a place with a good view so the user can enjoy their exercise, the app would display an ETA so the user can figure out when their walk/run would conclude. The app would then show different locations where the user can visit, those who chose the preference for the photography challenge would be recommended with a location where it will look best for their photo, those who chose the scavenger hunt will be recommended different locations where they can spend time exploring specific spots in their route. The user will be able to collect achievements from visiting different locations, these achievements can be displayed on the user’s profile. After the user’s walk/run is completed, the app will show the progress of their exercise in the progress page. The progress page will be able to show statistics of the user, such as the total amount of kilometres walked/ran, total steps and the total amount of time spent walking or running. The user will also have the option to track their daily progress by recording the stats under a diary. Under the community page, users who chose the photography challenge will be able to post their photo and receive likes from other users, those users would have the option to add a location to their pictures so that other users can find these locations and explore it themselves. The users of the app will be able to browse the community page where they can like the photos of other users and they can find different locations recommended by different users. The community page can have a forum where users can discuss different tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle and learn the steps taken by other users to achieve their health goal. With the help of a profile, the community page can be used to socialise with other individuals, users can make new friends and go on walks/runs with each other, creating a friendship can further motivate different individuals to live a healthier lifestyle. To ensure individuals are truly walking/running, the app will collect data from the kilometres walked, steps taken and the time it took them to complete their route. Each day, the app will recommend better locations when more users post pictures. The app can also be used worldwide, e.g. If a user decided to visit a new country, they could explore different landmarks and learn more about the country whilst getting some exercise. Some potential drawbacks I could encounter can be the user posting a photo that is not theirs. Some users may find the app less interesting since they might live in a location where it is hard to walk/run through a location with good scenery, therefore they might simply choose not to use the app. Some users may simply stop using the app if their photo doesn’t get recognised within the community page.</p>

                    <p class="interest-paragraph-1">Using inspiration from apps such as Google Maps will heavily contribute towards the development of the app. Since Google Maps have data of different locations around the world, it will be easier to craft the app since different routes can be formed with the help of Google Maps. Google Maps also have the feature of showing an ETA so the user can receive an accurate finishing time for their walk/run. Other apps, such as MyFitnessPal can be used as inspiration to create the discussion page and the progress page. The home page in MyFitnessPal provides helpful tips and videos towards its users so that the user can learn more about living a healthy lifestyle, the home page also shows a brief overview of the user’s progress which can save time. To create my project idea, I would use Visual Studio Code to craft my app since at includes all the necessary features.</p>

                    <p class="interest-paragraph-1">In order to create the app, I would need to learn how to program since it would allow me to create the different pages such as the community page, map page and progress page. Learning how to manage and resolve errors will be beneficial since there can be many specific errors within my program when it comes to creating an app. I should also learn how to style the app since it is an essential factor when it comes to usability. Learning these skills wouldn’t be too difficult since there are many different resources available on YouTube and Google that I can follow to create the app.</p>

                    <p class="interest-paragraph-1">If the project was successful, different users from across the world will be able to explore different locations. This app hopefully adds some kind of enjoyment when it comes to exercising outside since it provides the user with a task to complete. The app can also be a unique way for tourists to learn about unique locations in different countries, it will provide them with a reason to get some exercise and to explore their surroundings. Since the app is targeted towards those who use social media and fitness apps, those individuals will be able to socialise with others who share similar interests.</p>
